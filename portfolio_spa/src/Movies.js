                    <p>Pretty much everything in Moonfall is something you’ve seen from a disaster movie before. It is just hitting tropes left and right. If you’ve seen previous Roland Emmerich films, or even films from other directors with similar themes such as Michael Bay’s Armageddon (1998), you should have a pretty good idea of what you’re getting yourself into. You’ll never guess what the President’s generals want to do as soon as they find out that the moon is heading towards earth.</p>
                    <p>It all starts slowly because before the moon can start coming towards earth we have to establish all the personal problems in the main characters’ lives. How is every character estranged from this many people in their life, including each other?</p>
                    <p>Once we get past the beginning exposition, the movie gets good. I saw the movie in IMAX and the CGI looked pretty cool. They definitely made some strategic decisions with the appearance of some elements within the movie to make them easier to render.</p>
                    <p>Where the movie really shines for me is how ridiculous it is. I was impressed by Halle Berry, Patrick Wilson, and John Bradley for being able to deliver their lines with a straight face. For me, the biggest thrill watching Moonfall was seeing what insane thing the movie would come up with next. Moonfall is like a disaster movie and a Fast & Furious movie had a baby. There’s even a number of driving scenes, complete with gratuitous Lexus product placement.</p>
                    <p>The cast outside of Berry, Wilson, and Bradley was fine. Michael Pena’s role in Moonfall was originally supposed to be played by Stanley Tucci. When the movie started filming, Tucci was unable to travel from the UK to Canada due to COVID restrictions so Pena replaced him. I’m not sure if they made any changes to the role after this recasting because it feels like a perfect role for Tucci and an awkward fit for Pena. Either way, this is yet another thing COVID has cost us.</p>
                    <p>I thought Moonfall was a pretty good movie, but beyond that I’m happy that this movie got made. I love that Lionsgate decided to spend $140 million making this movie. I’m not sure how it’s going to make money, especially with a February release and COVID still depressing movie attendance. If you’re not interested in seeing a big dumb movie then I can’t recommend Moonfall to you. I can only tell you to get interested in seeing a big dumb movie. Nevertheless, I hope Moonfall makes enough money that we can get a sequel, which is lightly teased at the end of the movie. Hopefully, international audiences come through.</p>
